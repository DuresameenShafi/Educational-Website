                Looking back on my undergraduate journey at NED University, I am
                filled with immense gratitude for the exceptional opportunities
                and unwavering support I received from Dr. Sohail and the
                inspiring seniors of the NED SCHOLARS program. Their constant
                guidance and encouragement were instrumental in shaping my
                academic experience and propelling me forward. I truly
                appreciate the program's commitment to fostering a supportive
                learning environment that empowers students to reach their full
                potential.

                My experience with NED Scholars has been truly transformative. Not only have they provided me with valuable financial support, but they've also played a pivotal role in enhancing my skills and fostering my professional growth. Through their guidance and mentoring, I've had the privilege of participating in many seminars and diverse courses that have greatly enriched my knowledge. I am profoundly grateful to the director of NED Scholars, Sir Sohail and all the donors of NED Scholars for their incredible generosity and kind-heartedness. Without your support I would not have been able to complete my bachelor's degree
